# Data_Analysis_Project
Code for data analysis project on Gujarat's schools' data.

This is the code for data analysis project I worked on at IIT Gandhinagar during the summer break of 2016. I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and data visualisation on 10 years (2005-2015) of schools' data of Gujarat.


For a quick and brief summary of my project you can check out the poster file **PROJECT_POSTER.pdf**. And for the code and data I used please check out Data_Analysi_Proj folder.


There are three folders inside **Data_Analysis_Proj**. 

### 1. Main
Contains the data I used for the project and a Proj folder which contains main R project file for data analysis task together with main script for data cleaning, data manipulation, and calculating KPIs for schools.

### 2. Generated_Data
Contains the calculated KPIs for different schools in csv format. It will be used to generate plots for visualisation purposes.

### 3. Plots
Cotains folders Plots_Maps and Proj. Plots_Maps contain all the plots and maps created for the project. Proj folder contains an R project file for plotting all the maps and graphs and two script files for plots and maps respectively.
